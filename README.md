# DaysOfTheWeek_Project
This is the 2nd project I had to do, during my online course when I was first learning Python.

The exercise consisted of:
Creating a simple function where I receive the input of a day of the week when a holiday starts, and depending of the duration of such given holiday, I have to state which day of the week the such will be over.
All given into account that the week must start at Sunday as day 0 of the week, and finishing at day Saturday as day 6 of the week.

# Visual tests
If input is given as expected:

If input is given with random (or all) case letters:

If input is wrong:

If input is given with random spaces on the beginning and/or end of word:
