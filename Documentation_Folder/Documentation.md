## Firstly:
We added the 3 variables:
- **day_week** variable, which we used to store our <ins>string</ins> input, idealy refering to a day of the week.
- **length_stay** variable, which we used to store our <ins>integer</ins> input, regarding the duration of the client holiday.
- **days_of_week** variable, which we used to store our <ins>list</ins> input, with the week days in the correct order.

## Secondly:
We created a function and called it **endHolidays**, as a clear implication of its functionality, which will:
- Itenerate over the **days_of_week** list items, so we can:
   * Verify that the item (which is one of the week days), is compatible to the input provided, and if yes extract its index, before <ins>break<ins>ing out of the loop, or alternatly, verify that the input provided is not in the list and therefore return a invalid content text.
- Create another variable, this one inside of the function, so we can store the values of the (index plus the length of the holidays) before dividing it by the length of a week (which is 7 days).
- Return the end result stored on the function variable on a presentable and neat text for client perception of the provided function promised by the function

## Thirdly:
A simple call, in this case a print statement since I am not implimenting it just yet on any program, to initialize the function and make the whole code run.

### Extra comment:
With all this done, I was able to make some simple and fast tests to make sure the code is running as it should and correct the small mistakes left behind to prevent or correct them.
